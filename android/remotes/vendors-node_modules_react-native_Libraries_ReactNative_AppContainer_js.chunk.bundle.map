down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollView` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. This is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *

while providing\n * integration with touch locking \"responder\" system.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ScrollViews must have a bounded height in order to work,\n * since they contain unbounded-height children into a bounded container (via\n * a scroll interaction). In order to bound the height of a ScrollView, either\n * set the height of the view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent\n * views have bounded height. Forgetting to transfer `{flex: 1}` down the\n * view stack can lead to errors here, which the element inspector makes\n * easy to debug.\n *\n * Doesn't yet support other contained responders from blocking this scroll\n * view from becoming the responder.\n *\n *\n * `<ScrollView>` vs [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) - which one to use?\n *\n * `ScrollView` simply renders all its react child components at once. That\n * makes it very easy to understand and use.\n *\n * On the other hand, this has a performance downside. Imagine you have a very\n * long list of items you want to display, maybe several screens worth of\n * content. Creating JS components and native views for everything all at once,\n * much of which may not even be shown, will contribute to slow rendering and\n * increased memory usage.\n *\n * This is where `FlatList` comes into play. `FlatList` renders items lazily,\n * just when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off\n * screen to save memory and processing time.\n *\n * `FlatList` is also handy if you want to render separators between your items,\n * multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it\n * supports out of the box.\n */\nclass ScrollView extends React.Component               {\n  static Context                           = ScrollViewContext;\n\n  constructor(props       ) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this._scrollAnimatedValue = new AnimatedImplementation.Value(\n      this.props.contentOffset?.y ?? 0,\n    );\n    this._scrollAnimatedValue.setOffset(this.props.contentInset?.top ?? 0);\n  }\n\n  _scrollAnimatedValue                              ;\n  _scrollAnimatedValueAttachment                             = null;\n  _stickyHeaderRefs                                                           =\n    new Map();\n  _headerLayoutYs                      = new Map();\n\n  _keyboardMetrics                   = null;\n  _additionalScrollOffset         = 0;\n  _isTouching          = false;\n  _lastMomentumScrollBeginTime         = 0;\n  _lastMomentumScrollEndTime         = 0;\n\n  // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

wrapped view is decreased, which allows\n * the underlay color to show through, darkening or tinting the view.\n *\n * The underlay comes from wrapping the child in a new View, which can affect\n * layout, and sometimes cause unwanted visual artifacts if not used correctly,\n * for example if the backgroundColor of the wrapped view isn't explicitly set\n * to an opaque color.\n *\n * TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one).\n * If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```\n * renderButton: function() {\n *   return (\n *     <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onPressButton}>\n *       <Image\n *         style={styles.button}\n *         source={require('./myButton.png')}\n *       />\n *     </TouchableHighlight>\n *   );\n * },\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react'\n * import {\n *   AppRegistry,\n *   StyleSheet,\n *   TouchableHighlight,\n *   Text,\n *   View,\n * } from 'react-native'\n *\n * class App extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props)\n *     this.state = { count: 0 }\n *   }\n *\n *   onPress = () => {\n *     this.setState({\n *       count: this.state.count+1\n *     })\n *   }\n *\n *  render() {\n *     return (\n *       <View style={styles.container}>\n *         <TouchableHighlight\n *          style={styles.button}\n *          onPress={this.onPress}\n *         >\n *          <Text> Touch Here </Text>\n *         </TouchableHighlight>\n *         <View style={[styles.countContainer]}>\n *           <Text style={[styles.countText]}>\n *             { this.state.count !== 0 ? this.state.count: null}\n *           </Text>\n *         </View>\n *       </View>\n *     )\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n *   container: {\n *     flex: 1,\n *     justifyContent: 'center',\n *     paddingHorizontal: 10\n *   },\n *   button: {\n *     alignItems: 'center',\n *     backgroundColor: '#DDDDDD',\n *     padding: 10\n *   },\n *   countContainer: {\n *     alignItems: 'center',\n *     padding: 10\n *   },\n *   countText: {\n

(`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)\n * // later, on animation completion:\n * InteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);\n * // queued tasks run if all handles were cleared\n * ```\n *\n * `runAfterInteractions` takes either a plain callback function, or a\n * `PromiseTask` object with a `gen` method that returns a `Promise`.

Without setting this prop, `FlatList` would not know it\n *   needs to re-render any items because it is also a `PureComponent` and the prop comparison will\n *   not show any changes.\n * - `keyExtractor` tells the list to use the `id`s for the react keys instead of the default `key` property.\n *\n *\n *     class MyListItem extends React.PureComponent {\n *       _onPress = () => {\n *         this.props.onPressItem(this.props.id);\n *       };\n *\n *       render() {\n *         const textColor = this.props.selected ? \"red\" : \"black\";\n *         return (\n *           <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPress}>\n *             <View>\n *               <Text style={{ color: textColor }}>\n *                 {this.props.title}\n *               </Text>\n *             </View>\n *           </TouchableOpacity>\n *         );\n *       }\n *     }\n *\n *     class MultiSelectList extends React.PureComponent {\n *       state = {selected: (new Map(): Map<string, boolean>)};\n *\n *       _keyExtractor = (item, index) => item.id;\n *\n *       _onPressItem = (id: string) => {\n *         // updater functions are preferred for transactional updates\n *         this.setState((state) => {\n *           // copy the map rather than modifying state.\n *           const selected = new Map(state.selected);\n *           selected.set(id, !selected.get(id)); // toggle\n *           return {selected};\n *         });\n *       };\n *\n *       _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n *         <MyListItem\n *           id={item.id}\n *           onPressItem={this._onPressItem}\n *           selected={!!this.state.selected.get(item.id)}\n *           title={item.title}\n *         />\n *       );\n *\n *       render() {\n *         return (\n *           <FlatList\n *             data={this.props.data}\n *             extraData={this.state}\n *             keyExtractor={this._keyExtractor}\n *             renderItem={this._renderItem}\n *           />\n *         );\n *       }\n *     }\n *\n * This is a convenience wrapper around [`<VirtualizedList>`](docs/virtualizedlist.html),\n * and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed\n * here, along with the following caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\nclass FlatList        extends React.PureComponent                     {\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

Fully cross-platform.\n *  - Configurable viewability callbacks.\n *  - List header support.\n *  - List footer support.\n *  - Item separator support.\n *  - Section header support.\n *  - Section separator support.\n *  - Heterogeneous data and item rendering support.\n *  - Pull to Refresh.\n *  - Scroll loading.\n *\n * If you don't need section support and want a simpler interface, use\n * [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).\n *\n * Simple Examples:\n *\n *     <SectionList\n *       renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item} />}\n *       renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <Header title={section.title} />}\n *       sections={[ // homogeneous rendering between sections\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *         {data: [...], title: ...},\n *       ]}\n *     />\n *\n *     <SectionList\n *       sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},\n *       ]}\n *     />\n *\n * This is a convenience wrapper around [`<VirtualizedList>`](docs/virtualizedlist),\n * and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed\n * here, along with the following caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content.

Pressability implements press handling capabilities.\n *\n * =========================== Pressability Tutorial ===========================\n *\n * The `Pressability` class helps you create press interactions by analyzing the\n * geometry of elements and observing when another responder (e.g. ScrollView)\n * has stolen the touch lock. It offers hooks for your component to provide\n * interaction feedback to the user:\n *\n * - When a press has activated (e.g. highlight an element)\n * - When a press has deactivated (e.g. un-highlight an element)\n * - When a press should trigger an action, meaning it activated and deactivated\n *   while within the geometry of the element without the lock being stolen.\n *\n * A high quality interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should\n * be a slight delay before activation. Moving your finger beyond an element's\n * bounds should trigger deactivation, but moving the same finger back within an\n * element's bounds should trigger reactivation.\n *\n * This should be consumed by functional components using `usePressability`. The\n * following steps are only relevant for using `Pressability` in classes:\n *\n * 1. Instantiate `Pressability` and store it on your component's state.\n *\n *    state = {\n *      pressability: new Pressability({\n *        // ...\n *      }),\n *    };\n *\n * 2. Choose the rendered component who should collect the press events. On that\n *    element, spread `pressability.getEventHandlers()` into its props.\n *\n *    return (\n *      <View {...this.state.pressability.getEventHandlers()} />\n *    );\n *\n * 3. Update `Pressability` when your component mounts, updates, and unmounts.\n *\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      this.state.pressability.configure(...);\n *    }\n *\n *    componentDidUpdate() {\n *      this.state.pressability.configure(...);\n *    }\n *\n *    componentWillUnmount() {\n *      this.state.pressability.reset();\n *    }\n *\n * ==================== Pressability Implementation Details ====================\n *\n * `Pressability` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node. The `PressRect`\n * is an abstract box that is extended beyond the `HitRect`.\n *\n * # Geometry\n *\n *  ┌────────────────────────┐\n *  │  ┌──────────────────┐  │ - Presses start anywhere within `HitRect`, which\n *  │  │  ┌────────────┐  │  │   is expanded via the prop `hitSlop`.\n *  │  │  │ VisualRect │  │  │\n *  │  │  └────────────┘  │  │ - When pressed down for sufficient amount of time\n *  │  │    HitRect       │  │   before letting up, `VisualRect` activates for\n *  │  └──────────────────┘  │   as long as the press stays within `PressRect`.\n *  │       PressRect    o   │\n *  └────────────────────│───┘\n *          Out Region   └────── `PressRect`, which is expanded via the prop\n *                               `pressRectOffset`, allows presses to move\n *                               beyond `HitRect` while maintaining activation\n *                               and being eligible for a \"press\".\n *\n * # State Machine\n *\n * ┌───────────────┐ ◀──── RESPONDER_RELEASE\n * │ NOT_RESPONDER │\n * └───┬───────────┘ ◀──── RESPONDER_TERMINATED\n *     │\n *     │ RESPONDER_GRANT (HitRect)\n *     │\n *     ▼\n * ┌─────────────────────┐          ┌───────────────────┐              ┌───────────────────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │  T + DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_IN            ├────────▶ │ PRESS_IN          ├────────────▶ │ LONG_PRESS_IN     │\n * └─┬───────────────────┘          └─┬─────────────────┘              └─┬─────────────────┘\n *   │           ▲                    │           ▲                      │           ▲\n *   │LEAVE_     │                    │LEAVE_     │                      │LEAVE_     │\n *   │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_              │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_                │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_\n *   │           │PRESS_RECT          │           │PRESS_RECT            │           │PRESS_RECT\n *   ▼           │                    ▼           │                      ▼           │\n * ┌─────────────┴───────┐          ┌─────────────┴─────┐              ┌─────────────┴─────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │              │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_OUT           ├────────▶ │ PRESS_OUT         │              │ LONG_PRESS_OUT    │\n * └─────────────────────┘          └───────────────────┘              └───────────────────┘\n *\n * T + DELAY => LONG_PRESS_DELAY + DELAY\n *\n * Not drawn are the side effects of each transition.
